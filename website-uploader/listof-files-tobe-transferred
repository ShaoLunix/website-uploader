# When a folder is declared, its entirely path is created on the remote server
# if it doesnot exist yet and the entirely content of the folder is transferred.
# Commented texts are not interpreted by the script.
# You should only declare absolute paths.
# Below are some examples :
#/var/www/SOURCE.MYWEB.LOCAL/views/include/menus/
#/var/www/SOURCE.MYWEB.LOCAL/views/include/test.php
